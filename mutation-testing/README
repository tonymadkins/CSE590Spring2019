Testing
-------
Run 'ant test' to run all test cases.

Coverage
--------
Run './coverage.sh' to compute the coverage results. After completion, you can
view the html coverage report: reports/index.html

Mutation
--------
Run './mutation.sh' to compute the mutation score. After completion, the
following files provide additional information about the generated, killed, and
live mutants:
mutants.log: a summary of the generated mutants (i.e., what part of the code was
             changed and how).
killed.csv:  a summary of whether a mutant is still live or was killed with an
             exception/assertion/timeout.
summary.csv: a one-line summary that indicates how many mutants were generated
             and killed, and how long the analysis took.

Rather than reading the mutants.log file, you can show the source code
differences between a mutant and the original program by running:
./show_mutant.sh <mutant ID>
For example, './show_mutant.sh 20' shows how mutant 20 differs from the original
program.
